# TIC TAC TOE 2.1
## Abstract
If you are not acquainted with the game Tic Tac Toe, here you can find the rules for the
classical game: Rules for classical Tic Tac Toe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe
We want to bring the pen-and-paper classical game to the digital age, but with a little twist:
the size of the playfield should be configurable between 3x3 and 10x10. And we also want
the symbols (usually O and X) to be configurable. Also, it should be for 3 players instead of
just 2. A player can win the game by filling in a whole row, column or diagonal. If the
playfield is 5x5 - then the player must fill all the 5 cells in a row, column or diagonal to win.
The three players play all together against each other. One of the players is an AI. Who is
starting is random. In and output should be on the console. Input of the AI is automatic, no
user action should be required. After each move, the new state of the playfield is displayed
and the player can enter the next position of their character one after another. The next
position should be provided in a format like 3,2. Invalid inputs are expected to be handled
appropriately.
## Requirements
* Use the programming language you feel most comfortable with.
* Size of the playground. Valid values are between 3 and 10. This must be configurable
via configuration file.
* Player use a single character to mark their moves on the board. For example, X, O
and C. This must be configurable via configuration file.
